# Basics of regexp explained, as a reference for mostly-C programmers:
# (bash) "regexp-$VAR-regexp"  - bash' VARs are placed into "QUOTED" strings
# /\);?$/       - match end of function declaration, $ is end of string
# ^[ \t]*       - (heuristic), anything but comment, eg to exclude function docs
# /STH/, /END/  - (awk), print all lines sice STH matched, up to END, inclusive

# "Whitespace only"

# That simplifies process of excluding comments or spares us state machine impl.

# gen() - DSL-like function to wrap around all the other
#
# syntax:
#   gen DEFINE if (KIND [METHOD of]) NAME [(matches|lacks) PATTERN|absent] in <list-of-files>

# where:
#   DEFINE is HAVE_ or NEED_ #define to print;
#   `if` is there to just read it easier and made syntax easier to check;
#
#   NAME is the name for what we are looking for;
#
#   KIND specifies what kind of declaration/definition we are looking for,
#      could be: fun, enum, struct, method, macro, typedef,
#      'implementation of macro'
#   for KIND=method, we are looking for function ptr named METHOD in struct
#     named NAME (two optional args are then necessary (METHOD & of));
#
#   for KIND='implementation of macro' we are looking for the full
#     implementation of the macro, not just its first line. This is usually
#     combined with "matches" or "lacks".
#
#   next [optional] args could be used:
#     matches PATTERN - use to grep for the PATTERN within definition
#       (eg, for ext_ack param)
#     lacks - use to add #define only if there is no match of the PATTERN,
#       *but* the NAME is *found*
#     absent - the NAME that we grep for must be not found
#       (ie: function not exisiting)
#
#     without this optional params, behavior is the same as with
#       `matches .` - use to grep just for existence of NAME;
#
#   `in` is there to ease syntax, similar to `if` before.
#
#  <list-of-files> is just space-separate list of files to look in,
#    single (-) for stdin.
#
# PATTERN is awk pattern, will be wrapped by two slashes (/)
