Note for RHEL6/CentOS6/SL6
--------------------------

In RHEL6 and it's derivates (e.g CentOS, Scientific Linux) iproute package does
not have netns subcommand while kernel supports network namespaces. To overcome
this limitation you can rebuild (e.g. using mock) iproute-3.3.0-2.fc17.src.rpm
from Fedora 17 and install on target system.

Note that even with ip-netns(8) subcommand support kernel does not support
moving real network devices to network namespace other than initial: create
vlans in network namespace for */vlan.conf tests not moving real ones.
